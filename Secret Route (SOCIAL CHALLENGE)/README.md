# Secret Route (SOCIAL CHALLENGE)

## Overview
This section does not help you reach the medals quota for the Lega Hacktoberfest, instead here you can take part in a social challenge where you can show your Hacktoberfest spirit. 
With this simple quests you can interact with the Hacktoberfest community and let anyone know you are taking part in this international event.
These challenges may seem simple, but you’ll need sharp observational skills and the guts to capture the best moments of the day (and the faces of the professors).

We’ve hidden around campus {random number} statues that look more or less like {object description}. The 3 most observant teams who find the hidden objects and post an IG story tagging @todo_associazione, @unicamente_informatica, and @hacktoberfest can win the found object and bonus points, which will help them climb the leaderboard.

Additionally, by using your spy and paparazzi skills, if you manage to sneak a selfie with professors Barbara Re, Michele Loreti, Lorenzo Rossi, Andrea Morichetta, or Fausto Marcantoni and post it as an IG story tagging @todo_associazione and @unicamente_informatica, you can earn “spy points” to secretly rise up the leaderboard.

Lastly, to start the challenge on the right foot, post an IG story of the medal board showing your first earned medal and tag @todo_associazione, @unicamente_informatica, and all team members. Before heading to the long-awaited refreshment break, after earning the participation medal at the end of the event, post a new story, and with these last-minute points, you might flip the podium standings.

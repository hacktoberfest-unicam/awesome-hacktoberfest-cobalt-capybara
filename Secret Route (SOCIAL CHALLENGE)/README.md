# Secret Route (SOCIAL CHALLENGE)

## Overview
This section does not contribute towards the medals quota for the Lega Hacktoberfest, but instead offers a fun social challenge where you can showcase your Hacktoberfest spirit! These simple quests encourage interaction with the Hacktoberfest community, letting everyone know you're part of this international event.

The challenges may seem easy, but you’ll need sharp observational skills and the courage to capture the best moments of the day—including some sneaky photos of the professors!

We’ve hidden around campus (Polo B) **three statues** that resemble **pokémon**. The 3 most observant teams that find these hidden objects and post an Instagram story tagging **@todo_associazione**, **@unicamente_informatica**, and **@hacktoberfest** will win the found object.

Additionally, use your spy and paparazzi skills! If you manage to sneak a selfie with one of the following professors—**Barbara Re, Michele Loreti, Lorenzo Rossi, Andrea Morichetta, or Fausto Marcantoni**—and post it as an Instagram story tagging **@todo_associazione** and **@unicamente_informatica**.

Lastly, to kick off the challenge on the right foot, post an Instagram story of the medal board showing your first earned medal and tag **@todo_associazione**, **@unicamente_informatica**, and all team members. Don’t forget, before heading to the refreshment break at the end of the event, after earning the participation medal, post one last story.

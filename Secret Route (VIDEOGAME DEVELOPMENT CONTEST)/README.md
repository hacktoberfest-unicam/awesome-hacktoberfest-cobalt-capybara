# Side Quest (Videogame Development Contest)

## Overview
This section does not contribute toward the medals quota for the Lega Hacktoberfest, but offers an exciting challenge to enhance your teamwork skills and create real projects for a National Videogame Development contest. Your mission is to form a team and create a project proposal to participate in the **[Italian Game 2025 Contest](https://www.mimit.gov.it/it/incentivi/italiangame2025)**.

Form a group with friends and colleagues, ensuring all key roles are covered (e.g., Game Designer(s), Game Artist(s), Sound Engineer(s), Software Developer(s)). Your team will work on a project idea, prepare a presentation, and present it on stage at the end of the hackathon.

We will support the best project ideas during the development phase and the submission to the contest.

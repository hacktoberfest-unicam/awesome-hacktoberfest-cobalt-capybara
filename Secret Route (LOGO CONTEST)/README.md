# Side Quest (LOGO CONTEST)

## Overview
This section is a **side quest** and does not contribute toward the medals quota for the Lega Hacktoberfest. Instead, it offers you an opportunity to showcase your graphic design and 3D modeling skills. The **#TODO Student Union** and the **Computer Science Department** are looking for a creative logo or mascot that represents either #TODO or Computer Science.

At the end of the Hackathon, the teams that present the **top 3 logos** for either Computer Science or #TODO will have a chance to see their design used. Submissions can include both 2D sprites and images, as well as 3D printable models.

# Challenge: Pokèdex implementation

## Overview
This exercise focuses on implementing a mockup design you previously created for the second challenge of Palestra di Donald Norman *(Pokèdex Redraw)*. 
You will enhance your web development skills by bringing your design to life through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this challenge are to:
- Transform your mockup design into a functional webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Strengthen your understanding of web development by applying core concepts in a real-world scenario.
- Create a visually engaging and interactive webpage that reflects your design vision.

## Task Description
In this challenge, you will implement your previously designed mockup, creating an interactive webpage that includes:

1. **HTML:**
   - Create an `index.html` file.
   - Structure the layout according to your mockup, including headers, main content, and any necessary sections.
   - Ensure accessibility and semantic HTML practices.

2. **CSS:**
   - Create a `styles.css` file.
   - Style the webpage elements to match your mockup design, including typography, colors, and spacing.
   - Add responsive design techniques to ensure the webpage looks good on different screen sizes.

3. **JavaScript:**
   - Create a `script.js` file.
   - Implement any interactive features as per your mockup (e.g., buttons, forms, dynamic content updates).
   - Ensure a smooth user experience by handling events appropriately.

## Instructions
1. **Setup the Environment:**
   - Ensure you have a code editor installed (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
   - Create a new project directory for this challenge.

2. **Implement the Webpage:**
   - **HTML:**
     - Use your mockup as a reference to structure the `index.html`.
     - Include all necessary sections and elements.

   - **CSS:**
     - Define styles in `styles.css` to closely match your design.
     - Incorporate responsive design elements to adapt to different devices.

   - **JavaScript:**
     - Write scripts in `script.js` to add interactivity based on your design requirements.
     - Test all functionalities to ensure they align with your mockup.

3. **Testing:**
   - Open your `index.html` file in a web browser.
   - Verify that the webpage displays correctly and matches your mockup design.
   - Test all interactive elements to ensure they function as intended.

## Submission
- Create a GitHub repository for your project.
- Push your code to the repository.
- Ensure your repository includes the following files:
  - `index.html`
  - `styles.css`
  - `script.js`
  - `README.md` (this file)

## Pseudocode Overview
- **HTML:**

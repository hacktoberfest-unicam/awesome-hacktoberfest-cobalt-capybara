# Palestra di Haskell Curry (Functional Programming)
## Overview
The Haskell Curry Workshop offers an engaging environment tailored to enhance your functional programming skills. 
Named after the renowned logician and computer scientist Haskell Curry, this program invites you to delve into the core principles of functional programming while mastering the Haskell language. 
Through a series of thought-provoking tasks and practical applications, you’ll develop the ability to write clean, efficient, and expressive code that embodies the best practices of functional programming.

## Objective
The objective of the Haskell Curry Workshop is to equip you with the essential skills and understanding necessary to excel in functional programming. 
By completing a thoughtfully crafted series of challenges, you will learn to think functionally and apply concepts such as immutability, higher-order functions, and type systems. 
By the end of the workshop, you will be prepared to build robust and maintainable applications using Haskell.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Sanity check
Description: You will implement a basic functional programming task. Specifically, you will create a function that performs operations on a list of integers. 

### Challenge 2: Pokémon Damage Calculator
Description: The primary objective of this challenge is to implement a function that calculates the total damage a Pokémon would suffer from a list of enemy moves, taking into account the Pokémon's type weaknesses.

### Challenge 3: Pokédex Filter
Description: Use higher-order functions (e.g., filter, map) to obtain a list of Pokémon of a certain type.

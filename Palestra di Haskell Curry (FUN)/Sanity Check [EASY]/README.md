# Challenge: Sanity Check - Basic Functional Programming

## Overview
Welcome to the "Sanity Check" challenge in the Functional Programming category! This challenge is designed to verify your understanding of fundamental functional programming concepts. You will implement a simple functional programming task to ensure you are comfortable with basic concepts like immutability, higher-order functions, and pure functions.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this challenge are to:
- Implement a basic functional programming task.
- Understand and apply fundamental functional programming principles.
- Practice writing clean, immutable, and functional code.

## Task Description
In this challenge, you will implement a basic functional programming task. Specifically, you will create a function that performs operations on a list of integers. This exercise will help you solidify your understanding of core functional programming concepts.

## Instructions
1. **Setup the Environment:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary environment set up for your chosen programming language.
   - Create a new project directory for this challenge.
   - Initialize a Git repository in the project directory (optional).

2. **Implement the Function:**
   - Choose one of the following tasks:
     - **Task 1: Sum of Squares**
       - Implement a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of their squares.
       - Example: `sum_of_squares([1, 2, 3])` should return `14` because \(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14\).
     - **Task 2: Filter Even Numbers**
       - Implement a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.
       - Example: `filter_even([1, 2, 3, 4])` should return `[2, 4]`.

3. **Code Structure:**
   - Create a file for your implementation (e.g., `functional_programming.py` for Python, `FunctionalProgramming.java` for Java).
   - Implement the function in this file.

4. **Testing:**
   - Create test cases to validate your function.
   - Ensure that your implementation handles edge cases, such as an empty list.

## Submission
- Create a GitHub repository for your project.
- Push your code to the repository.
- Ensure your repository includes the following files:
  - Your implementation file (e.g., `functional_programming.py`, `FunctionalProgramming.java`).
  - `README.md` (this file).
  - `tests/` (directory containing your test cases).

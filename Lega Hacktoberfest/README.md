# Lega Hacktoberfest

## Overview
Welcome to the **Lega Hacktoberfest**, a dedicated space for honing your skills in working with frameworks and completing complex projects. Access to the `Lega Hacktoberfest` is granted only to those who have shown admirable skills in the `Palestra` and received at least four (4) `Medals`.

## Objective
The primary objective of the **Lega Hacktoberfest** is to let you:
- Apply the concepts you learned while tackling the various challenges in the `Palestra`.
- Work with complex frameworks.
- Develop complex and useful applications.

## Projects
Unlike the `Palestra` challenges you have encountered so far, the projects here assume that you are already proficient in several aspects of IT. Each project is designed to be completed in a group and presents a higher level of difficulty compared to the challenges. However, don’t be discouraged! These projects are an important milestone in understanding how software is developed and how to collaborate with others, either in a team or globally.

The projects differ from the previous challenges as they don’t have specific objectives beyond those listed above. Since we evaluate multiple factors (e.g., code clarity and polish, readability, absence of bugs, availability on hosted platforms, competition, etc.), it is not possible to provide a precise and specific objective.

### Project 1: RESTful Service
**Description**: Develop a RESTful Service that helps you with one of your hobbies or daily tasks. The service should provide [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations, including authentication for critical ones. It should offer functionalities that are useful to the end user. If possible, present your idea to us before starting development; we may help you refine the project or adjust the difficulty to fit the remaining time. While the frontend is not mandatory, it is highly recommended to provide API documentation and a simple interface or a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) test suite to interact with the created service.

The bot should be available via a public tag (though you can host it on your local machine for testing purposes) and provide useful functionalities. Present your idea to us beforehand, and we can help you refine or adjust the project based on the remaining time. The bot should be self-explanatory and straightforward to use, with a `Help` command that lists all available commands and their descriptions. Additionally, it should interact with an online resource or API.

### Project 3: AI Poker Tournament
**Description**: We’ve provided the framework source code in [this folder](AI%20Poker%20Competition/). Your task is to develop your own AI that plays Poker. It doesn’t need to be a Deep Learning model; statistical methods, randomness, or Machine Learning can work well. The framework is a Java Maven project, and some AI examples are provided. If you need further details, ask us! At the end of the Hackathon, we will run all the AIs in a tournament, and the winner will receive a special prize.

> [!NOTE]  
> We are aware of some bugs in the framework code (it was developed quickly from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. one Sunday), but we couldn’t reproduce them to fix them. Extra points will be awarded to teams who find and provide a workaround or fix for these bugs. A detailed explanation of the bug and the fix/workaround will be required for evaluation.

### Project 4: Open Project
**Description**: The above projects are just ideas to start with and explore various IT fields. If you have an idea for a complex project, come talk to us and present it to everyone. We may accept your idea and add it as a challenge for all participants.

> [!NOTE]  
> While there are no specific limitations for the `Lega Hacktoberfest`, we strongly recommend using JavaScript/TypeScript, Python 3, and/or Java (along with related frameworks) to complete the projects. These languages are among the most widely used in IT and are highly ranked in the [2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-most-popular-technologies) and [2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#most-popular-technologies) Stack Overflow Technology Surveys.

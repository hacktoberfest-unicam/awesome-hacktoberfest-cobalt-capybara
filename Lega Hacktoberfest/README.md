# Lega Hacktoberfest

## Overview
Welcome to the Lega Hacktoberfest, a dedicated space for honing your skills in working with Frameworks and completing complex projects. Access to the `Lega Hacktoberfest` is granted only to the ones that have shown admirable skills in the `Palestra` and received at least four (4) `Medals`.

## Objective
The primary objective of the Lega Hacktoberfest is to let you:
- Apply the concepts you learnt while fighting the different `Palestra`.
- Work with complex Frameworks.
- Develop complex and useful Applications.

## Projects
Unlike the `Palestra` you have encountered so far, here you'll find a variety of Projects that assume you are already proficient in several aspect of IT. Each Project is meant to be completed in group and present a higher difficulty with respect to the Challenges you have faced so far, but don't get discouraged too early, the projects are an important milestone towards understanding how software is developed and how to work and collaborate with other people in the same team or in the world.
Unlike the challenges you faced so far, the projects have no specific objective, as the objectives are the one listed above. Also, since we will consider a set of factors to evaulate them (e.g. code clarity and polish, readibility, absence of bugs, availability on hosted platforms, competitors, ...), it is not possible to provide a clear and specific objective.

### Project 1: RESTful Service
**Description**: Develop a RESTful Service that can help you in one of your hobbies or in your daily life. The service should provide the [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations with an eventual authentication for the most critical ones, and should be able to provide a set of functionalities that can be useful to the end user. If possible, come talk with us and present your idea before starting the development, we may help you in refining your project and make it more or less challenging to fit the available remaining time. You may also find other like-minded people that can develop the project with you. Also, the frontend is not mandatory, but it is strongly suggested to provide the APIs documentation and a simple interface or a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) test suite to interact with the created service.

### Project 2: Telegram Bot
**Description**: Develop a [Telegram BOT](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) that can help you in one of your hobbies or in your daily life. The service should be available at a public tagname (you can host it on your local machine only to allow us to try it) and should be able to provide a consistent set of functionalities that can be useful to the end user. If possible, come talk with us and present your idea before starting the development, we may help you in refining your project and make it more or less challenging to fit the available remaining time. You may also find other like-minded people that can develop the project with you. Also, we expect the BOT to be self-explanatory, simple, and straightforward to use, so the documentation is not mandatory, but it is strongly suggested to provide a simple interface (e.g. a welcome message and button menus to interact with the BOT). The Help command should be able to provide a list of all the available commands and a brief description of them. Lastly, we expect the bot to interact with some online resource or API.

**Suggested Languages and Frameworks**: Following are listed the suggested languages, frameworks and resources to use for the project and their competence area.
- Suggested Frameworks (full list available at the following [link](https://core.telegram.org/bots/samples)):
  - Python (Strongly Suggested): [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)
  - Java: [TelegramBots](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots)
  - Node.js [Telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf)
- (Other Resources) List of Open APIs: 
  - [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
  - [Free APIs](https://free-apis.github.io/#/)

### Project 3: AI Poker Tournament
**Description**: We provided the framework source code in [this folder](AI%20Poker%20Competition/). Your task is to develop your own AI that plays Poker (does not need to be a Deep Learning model, even statistical methods, randomness and Machine Learning can work well). The framework is a Java Maven project and some "AI" examples are provided as a reference. Ask us for any further information that was not in the folder README file. At the end of the Hackathon, we will run all the AIs in a tournament and the winner will receive a special prize.
> [!NOTE]
> We know there are bugs in the Framework source code (sorry it was developed in 2 hours from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. on a random Sunday), but we  were not able to reproduce the errors and therefore fix them. 
> Will award extra points to the team that will spot them and provide a workaround or a fix. 
> Of course, we will need a detailed explanation of the bug and the fix/workaround, so we can evaluate it properly.

### Project 4: Open Project
**Description**: The previous projects are only ideas to start with and discover the IT field you like the most. If you have an idea for a complex project, come talk with us and present it to everyone, we may accept your idea and add it as a challenge for all the participants.


> [!NOTE]
> While there are no specific limitations to the `Lega Hacktoberfest`. 
> We strongly suggest using JavaScript/TypeScript, Python 3 and/or Java (along with related frameworks) to complete the Projects, as these languages are the most used in IT multinational companies and are among the most important technologies as reported by StackOverflow in the [2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-most-popular-technologies) and [2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#most-popular-technologies) Technology Surveys.

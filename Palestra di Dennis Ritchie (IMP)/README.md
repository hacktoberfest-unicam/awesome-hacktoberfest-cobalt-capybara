# Palestra di Dennis Ritchie - Imperative Programming (IMP)

## Overview
Welcome to the Palestra di Dennis Ritchie, a dedicated space for mastering the art of Imperative Programming (IMP). Named in honor of Dennis Ritchie, the co-creator of the C programming language and a pioneer of imperative programming, this category is designed to help you develop a deep understanding of programming paradigms that focus on explicitly describing the steps your code should take to achieve a desired outcome.

## Objective
The primary objective of this category is to:
- Understand and apply the core principles of imperative programming, including sequence, selection, and iteration.
- Write code that directly manipulates program state through variables, loops, and conditionals.
- Develop problem-solving skills by breaking down tasks into step-by-step instructions that a computer can execute.
- Gain proficiency in using control structures, such as loops and conditionals, to manage program flow.

## Challenges
### Challenge 1: Item Inventory
**Description:** Welcome to the Item Inventory Management Challenge! In this exercise, you will create a system to manage an inventory of items like potions, Pokéballs, and other in-game objects. <br>
**Objective:** The goal of this challenge is to develop your ability to manage program flow using loops and conditionals, while building an inventory system. You'll practice adding, removing, and updating items in data structures like lists or dictionaries, improving your skills in state management and imperative programming.

### Challenge 2: Pokemon Battle
**Description:** You'll create a program that simulates a turn-based battle between two Pokémon. The focus is on using loops and conditional statements to manage the battle flow, where each Pokémon takes turns attacking until one faints.
**Objective:** The goal is to apply fundamental programming concepts like loops and conditionals to simulate a Pokémon battle, while practicing writing clean and well-structured code.

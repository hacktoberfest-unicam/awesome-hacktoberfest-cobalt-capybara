# Palestra di Dennis Ritchie - Imperative Programming (IMP)

## Overview
Welcome to the Palestra di Dennis Ritchie, a dedicated space for mastering the art of Imperative Programming (IMP). Named in honor of Dennis Ritchie, the co-creator of the C programming language and a pioneer of imperative programming, this category is designed to help you develop a deep understanding of programming paradigms that focus on explicitly describing the steps your code should take to achieve a desired outcome.

## Objective
The primary objective of this category is to:
- Understand and apply the core principles of imperative programming, including sequence, selection, and iteration.
- Write code that directly manipulates program state through variables, loops, and conditionals.
- Develop problem-solving skills by breaking down tasks into step-by-step instructions that a computer can execute.
- Gain proficiency in using control structures, such as loops and conditionals, to manage program flow.

# Poké Mart Controller Challenge (UI/UX Mockup)

## Overview
Welcome to the **Poké Mart Controller Challenge**! In this task, you will design a mockup for a mobile app that allows users to manage a virtual Poké Mart. The app should offer customization features, enabling users to add or remove items or categories, while also providing real-time visual feedback in the form of graphs and data visualizations. Your focus should be on creating an intuitive and efficient interface that simplifies the management of the Poké Mart for users.

## Objective
The primary objective of this challenge is to create a functional and user-friendly mobile app design that allows users to personalize their Poké Mart experience, visualize real-time data, and navigate the app effortlessly. By the end of this challenge, you should be able to:
- Design a streamlined interface for managing and customizing Poké Mart inventory and categories.
- Provide real-time visual feedback with graphs and plots displaying key metrics about the Poké Mart’s performance.
- Focus on smooth navigation and user-friendly interactions with the app, optimizing for smart devices.

## Accepted Tools
You can use any of the following design tools to create your mockup:
- Figma
- Adobe XD
- Sketch
- InVision
- Balsamiq (for low-fidelity wireframes)

## Instructions

### 1. **Set Up Your Design Environment:**
   - Choose your preferred design tool and create a new project.
   - Set up artboards for a mobile interface, ensuring the design is optimized for smartphones and other smart devices.
   - (Optional) Use a version control system or design repository to track your work and iterations.

### 2. **Key Features to Design:**

   - **Customization and Personalization:**
     - Design an interface that allows users to easily add or remove items and categories from their Poké Mart.
     - Provide customizable templates or layouts for the Poké Mart storefront, allowing users to rearrange sections based on their preferences.
     - Include a search function that lets users quickly find items or categories to add/remove from their inventory.

   - **Real-Time Visualizations:**
     - Integrate data visualizations such as graphs, bar charts, or line plots that reflect the Poké Mart’s current status (e.g., sales trends, item stock levels, customer traffic).
     - Ensure that these visualizations update in real-time and are easy to interpret at a glance.
     - Provide users with the option to view specific metrics, filter data, or zoom into particular timeframes for deeper analysis.

   - **Inventory and Sales Management:**
     - Design inventory tracking tools that display item availability, stock levels, and reorder alerts for popular products.
     - Include a sales dashboard that shows recent sales performance, daily revenue, and other key business metrics.
     - Implement notifications or alerts for critical updates, such as low stock or sales milestones.

   - **Responsive and Intuitive Navigation:**
     - Focus on a clean and straightforward navigation system that ensures users can move between sections effortlessly (e.g., inventory, sales, settings).
     - Utilize touch gestures or swipes to enhance usability, especially for actions like removing items, viewing sales stats, or switching between categories.
     - Ensure a smooth, intuitive user experience, with quick access to essential features like customization, reports, and inventory management.

### 3. **Bonus Features:**
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for users to rearrange items and categories within their Poké Mart.
   - Include a forecasting feature that uses sales data to predict future trends and suggest item restocking or promotional strategies.
   - Allow users to switch between different visual themes for their Poké Mart, providing light/dark modes or seasonal themes.

## Design Deliverables
Your project should include the following design components:
- **High-Fidelity Mockups:** Provide detailed mockups of the mobile app, showcasing key features like item customization, real-time data visualizations, and navigation.
- **Wireframes (optional):** If applicable, include low-fidelity wireframes that demonstrate the basic layout and structure of the app before moving to more polished designs.
- **Data Visualization Examples:** Ensure that your mockups highlight different types of graphs or plots that reflect the real-time status of the Poké Mart (e.g., bar charts for sales, line graphs for stock levels).

## Testing
- Conduct user testing by sharing your mockup with a small group of testers.
- Gather feedback on ease of use, navigation, and the clarity of visualizations and personalization features.
- Iterate on your design based on feedback to improve user experience.

## Submission
- Create a GitHub repository or design tool share link for your project.
- Ensure your submission includes:
  - A README.md file that explains your design approach and key features.
  - Screenshots or exported versions of your final mockups, highlighting key functionality.
  - A link to an interactive prototype, if applicable.

# Palestra di Edsger Dijkstra (ASD)

## Overview
Welcome to the **Palestra di Edsger Dijkstra**, a specialized training ground for mastering **Algorithms and Data Structures (ASD)**. Named after Edsger Dijkstra, a renowned computer scientist celebrated for his profound contributions to algorithm theory, this gym is designed to help you sharpen your skills in designing, implementing, and analyzing algorithms.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this ASD gym are to help you:
- Understand both fundamental and advanced algorithms.
- Master the implementation of various data structures.
- Develop strong problem-solving skills through practical exercises.
- Analyze the efficiency and performance of algorithms.

## Challenges
This gym offers a range of challenges focused on enhancing your understanding of algorithms and data structures, particularly search and sorting techniques. Each challenge targets specific skills and concepts to help you practice and develop expertise in these areas.

### Challenge 1: Pokémon Search in the Pokédex
**Description**: Implement a search algorithm to locate a specific Pokémon in a Pokédex. You will work with structured data and explore different searching techniques like linear search, binary search, or hash-based lookups.  
**Objective**: Apply and compare search algorithms in terms of efficiency and performance when working with structured data.

### Challenge 2: Sorting Pokémon by Health Points
**Description**: Implement various sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) to sort a list of Pokémon based on their health points. This challenge allows you to understand the inner workings of sorting algorithms and their relative performance.  
**Objective**: Learn and analyze the efficiency of different sorting algorithms by comparing their time and space complexities in real-world scenarios.

### Challenge 3: Pokémon Battle Damage Calculation
**Description**: In this challenge, you will develop an algorithm to calculate the damage inflicted during a Pokémon battle. Using various data structures to represent Pokémon attributes (like attack power, defense stats, and type advantages), you will create a system that evaluates move effectiveness and computes the resulting damage.  
**Objective**: 
- Utilize appropriate data structures (e.g., classes, dictionaries, or lists) to store and manage Pokémon attributes and move data.
- Apply mathematical algorithms to calculate battle damage based on attributes such as attack, defense, and type advantages.
- Strengthen your problem-solving skills by implementing logical algorithms that handle real-world data manipulation challenges.

## Tools and Resources
There are no restrictions on programming languages or development environments for these challenges. Choose any tools or resources that you're comfortable with. We recommend using any of the following:
- Python, Java, C++, or JavaScript for algorithm implementation.
- Online platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) to practice additional problems.
- Libraries like Python’s `timeit` or Java's `System.nanoTime` to measure algorithm efficiency.

### Additional Notes
- Focus on writing clean and efficient code. Make sure to test and compare the performance of different algorithms.
- Use comments and documentation to explain the thought process behind your solutions.
- Pay attention to edge cases and handle input data validation where necessary.

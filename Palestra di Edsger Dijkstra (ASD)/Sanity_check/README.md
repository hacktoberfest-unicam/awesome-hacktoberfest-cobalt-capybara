# Challenge: Sanity Check - Basic Sorting Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
Welcome to the "Sanity Check" challenge in the Algorithms and Data Structures category! This challenge is designed to ensure you have a firm grasp of implementing basic sorting algorithms. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science, and mastering it is essential for tackling more complex problems.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this challenge are to:
- Implement a basic sorting algorithm, such as Bubble Sort or Selection Sort.
- Understand the step-by-step process of sorting an array or list of numbers.
- Gain insight into the time complexity and efficiency of basic sorting algorithms.

## Task Description
In this challenge, you will implement a basic sorting algorithm of your choice. You will write the algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order and then test the implementation to ensure it functions correctly.

## Instructions
1. **Setup the Environment:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary environment set up for your chosen programming language.
   - Create a new project directory for this challenge.
   - Initialize a Git repository in the project directory (optional).

2. **Write the Sorting Algorithm Implementation:**
   - Choose a basic sorting algorithm to implement, such as Bubble Sort or Selection Sort.
   - Write a function or method that takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list.
   - Ensure your implementation handles different cases, including an already sorted list and a list with duplicate values.

3. **Code Structure:**
   - Create a file for your implementation (e.g., `bubble_sort.py` for Python, `SelectionSort.java` for Java).
   - Implement the sorting algorithm clearly and correctly.

4. **Function Signatures:**
   - Ensure your method follows the signature for your chosen language. Examples:
     - **Python (Bubble Sort):**
       ```python
       def bubble_sort(arr):
           # Sorting code
           return arr
       ```
     - **Java (Selection Sort):**
       ```java
       public class SelectionSort {
           public static int[] sort(int[] arr) {
               // Sorting code
               return arr;
           }
       }
       ```

5. **Testing:**
   - Create test cases to validate your sorting algorithm.
   - Ensure your implementation handles edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with one element, and a list with all identical elements.

## Submission
- Create a GitHub repository for your project.
- Push your code to the repository.
- Ensure your repository includes the following files:
  - Your implementation file (e.g., `bubble_sort.py`, `SelectionSort.java`).
  - `README.md` (this file).
  - `tests/` (directory containing your test cases).

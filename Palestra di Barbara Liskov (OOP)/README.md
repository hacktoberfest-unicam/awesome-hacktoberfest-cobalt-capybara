# Palestra di Barbara Liskov (OOP)

## Overview
Welcome to the Palestra di Barbara Liskov, a dedicated space for honing your skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This set of challenges is inspired by the pioneering work of Barbara Liskov, a computer scientist who significantly contributed to the principles and practice of OOP.

## Objective
The primary objective of this OOP gym is to help you:
- Understand the core principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Implement classes and objects to model real-world scenarios.
- Design and develop software that is modular, reusable, and maintainable.

## Challenges
Here, you'll find a variety of challenges that will progressively build your understanding and proficiency in OOP. Each challenge is designed to focus on specific aspects of OOP and provide practical experience through coding exercises.

### Challenge 1: Pokémon Class Creation

# Palestra di Barbara Liskov (OOP)

## Overview
Welcome to the Palestra di Barbara Liskov, a dedicated space for honing your Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills. These challenges are inspired by the pioneering work of Barbara Liskov, a renowned computer scientist who has significantly contributed to the principles and practice of OOP.

## Objective
The primary objective of this OOP gym is to help you:
- Understand the core principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Implement classes and objects to model real-world scenarios.
- Design and develop software that is modular, reusable, and maintainable.

## Challenges
Here, you'll find a variety of challenges that will progressively build your understanding and proficiency in OOP. Each challenge is designed to focus on specific aspects of OOP and provide practical experience through coding exercises.

### Challenge 1: Pokémon Evolution System
**Description:** Create a class that manages the evolution of Pokémon when they reach a certain level, using inheritance and polymorphism. <br> **Objective:** Understand and apply the principles of inheritance and polymorphism.

### Challenge 2: Pokémon Battle Arena
**Description:** Develop a fully functional battle system between two Pokémon. You will create multiple classes to represent different Pokémon types, abilities, and moves. The battle system should simulate turn-based combat, with each Pokémon strategically using its abilities. You will also implement the battle logic, accounting for move types, damage calculation, and type-based weaknesses.  
**Objective:** Strengthen your skills in advanced OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and composition. Additionally, you will practice abstraction by designing a battle system that can be extended to accommodate new Pokémon and features in the future.

### Challenge 3: Backpack Inventory
In this challenge, you'll create an object-oriented inventory system that simulates a Pokémon Trainer's backpack. You'll define classes to represent the backpack and items, allowing trainers to add or remove items just like in the Pokémon games. Interaction with the backpack will occur via the terminal, providing a hands-on experience with user input and output in your chosen programming language.

# Palestra di Barbara Liskov (OOP)

## Overview
Welcome to the Palestra di Barbara Liskov, a dedicated space for honing your skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This set of challenges is inspired by the pioneering work of Barbara Liskov, a computer scientist who significantly contributed to the principles and practice of OOP.

## Objective
The primary objective of this OOP gym is to help you:
- Understand the core principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Implement classes and objects to model real-world scenarios.
- Design and develop software that is modular, reusable, and maintainable.

## Challenges
Here, you'll find a variety of challenges that will progressively build your understanding and proficiency in OOP. Each challenge is designed to focus on specific aspects of OOP and provide practical experience through coding exercises.

### Challenge 1: Pokémon Class Creation
**Description**: Define a class `Pokemon` with attributes like name, type, health points, and moves. Implement methods for attacking and defending. <br>
**Objective**: Learn the basics of class definitions, attributes, and methods.

### Challenge 2: Pokémon Evolution System
**Description**: Create a class that manages the evolution of Pokémon when they reach a certain level using inheritance and polymorphism.<br>
**Objective**: Understand and apply the principles of inheritance and polymorphism.

### Challenge 3: Pokémon Battle Arena
**Description:** Implement a fully-fledged battle system between two Pokémon. You will define multiple classes to represent different types of Pokémon, abilities, and moves. The battle system should simulate turns, with each Pokémon using their abilities strategically. You will implement the battle logic, taking into account different types of moves, damage calculation, and weaknesses based on type. <br>
**Objective:** To gain proficiency in advanced OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and composition. Additionally, you will practice abstraction by designing a battle system that is extendable for future Pokémon and features.
